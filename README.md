# Morphs public projects portfolio package ðŸ˜•
Here you will find all my public stuff, whether it is just a proof of concept, or a project you can slap on a web server and customize. I hope you understand that the code posted on here will be sanitized, just to keep things safe.The things removed will most likely just be API keys or odd bit of secret code that I don't feel like sharing.

# Projects:
## Below are a list of my projects and a few lines describing what they do.

## Calendar

I was tasked by a community of non techy people to create a complex calendar to add events, notify people, write in if you are attending, and a whole lot of other things besides. Uploaded to my github and gitlab is a dumbed down version written in python, using flask and many other weird things, that should just work, full documentation on its repo. Docker images and PHP version might be coming soon if I ever get around to it.
